Otto G. Richter Library |  Special Collections, 8th Floor<br />
Tuesday, November 13, 2012 at 6 p.m.</h5>
<p>The UM Libraries continues its Year of Humanities and Arts celebrations with a unique evening of staged readings from the zine and fringe literature materials from Special Collections. Originating in the early 20th century as a mode of communication amongst science fiction fans, “zines” (fanzines) grew in popularity during the 1970s punk rock scene. Students, faculty members, and UM staff members will be reading from a variety of zine collections, including the one donated by the Firefly Collective, a Miami-based activist and education group.  Come and hear readings spanning from the golden age of zines (the late 1970s and 80s) to the present.</p>

</strong><strong>Friday, October 26, 2012 |  6:30 pm<br />
</strong><strong>Otto G. Richter Library  </strong></p>
<p>On Friday, October 26, President Donna Shalala and Dean William Walker hosted a celebration to commemorate The Otto G. Richter Library’s 50<sup>th</sup> Anniversary.</p>
<p>“In 50 short years we have built one of the most important information resources in the country,” said William Walker, Dean and University Librarian, to an audience of friends, trustees, and donors. Built for $3 million in 1962, it has grown into one of Florida’s largest repositories for broad and deep research collections.</p>
<p>Library curators mounted a Library treasures exhibition, which included materials such as a slave register from 1824, Randy Barcelo’s theater costume designs, and letters by Federico Garcia Lorca. At the beginning of the fall semester, University Archive images that demonstrate the Library’s growth over the past years were installed down the Library’s breezeway.</p>
<p>The event included a reception followed by a conversation between President Shalala and the Pulitzer Prize-winning SouthFlorida writer, Dave Barry.  As the conversation drew to a close, Dean Walker presented Mr. Barry with a special recognition for his work capturing the spirit of South Florida for almost 30 years.</p>

<p><strong>A Conversation with Ruth and Marvin Sackner</strong><br />
<strong>Tuesday, October 23, 2012 </strong><br />
<strong>Reception 6:00 pm/ Lecture 6:45 pm<br />
</strong><strong>Otto G. Richter Library  |  Special Collections, 8th Floor</strong></p>
<p>When Ruth and Marvin Sackner founded the Sackner Archive of Concrete and Visual Poetry in 1979, its initial mission was to establish a collection of books, critical texts, periodicals, ephemera, prints, drawings, collages, paintings, sculptures, objects, manuscripts, and correspondence dealing with precedent and contemporary, internationally produced, examples of those styles. After more than thirty years of intensive, meticulous, and discerning collecting, they have built one of the finest collections of its kind in the world. This world-class archive now contains some of the finest books and art pieces documenting such pivotal twentieth-century art movements as Italian Futurism, Russian and Eastern European Avant Garde, Dada, Surrealism, Bauhaus, De Stijl, Ultra, Tabu-Dada, Lettrisme, and Ultra-Lettrisme. Please join us in a stimulating conversation with the Sackners and find out more about their collection, the curatorial decisions inherent in building it, and their fascinating encounters with the artists behind the works.</p>

Thursday, September 20, 2012 at 6pm</strong><br />
<strong> Otto G. Richter Library | 8th Floor Special Collections</strong></p>
<p>Acclaimed French artist and author Didier Mutel combines his deep knowledge of the craft of printing and engraving and his rebellious, punk-inspired revolutionary personal style to construct and deconstruct what we think of as a book. Working in one of the last surviving 18<sup>th</sup> century printers’ studios in Paris, Mutel mixes up classical methodologies and new technologies to create works that have both visual elegance and visceral power.  The University of Miami Special Collections has acquired one of the (very) limited edition copies of Mutel&#8217;s <em>Forbes Simulacrum</em>, which he defines as “a Danse Macabre for Billionaires,”  a take-off on the traditional Medieval text in which Death visits a variety of recognizable human types.  In his oversized, beautifully executed text, Death will be visiting a variety of billionaires from the Forbes list of richest people in the world.  Come view the book, watch a video of Mutel creating an engraving in the time it takes to hear Sid Vicious’ version of Frank Sinatra’s “My Way,” and hear his fascinating stories about re-envisioning the art of fine printing.</p>

The Lynda and Michael Gordon Exhibition Program<br />
Fall Semester 2012</p>
<p>Throughout history, protests have changed the way people think and the way nations govern.  This exhibition explores some important 20th- and 21st-century protest themes through musical scores, contemporary zines, artists&#8217; books, and poems by celebrated protest writers.  By touching on a range of protest from antiwar to human rights, we invite viewers to contemplate these powerful and lyrical messages of hope, peace, and change.</p>

</strong>Marta and Austin Weeks Music Library<br />
Fall Semester 2012</p>
<p>One of the foremost pioneers of avant-garde music in the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century, John Cage is most well-known for his aleatory or “chance” compositions, over which he had little or no influence organization, performance, or, in some cases, even the compositional process itself. Cage’s most significant aleatory composition is his signature work <em>4’33”</em>, which was composed for any instrument or combination of instruments and consists of three movements in which the performer or performers produces not a single note of music; instead, the “music” is the ambient sound of the performing space. His compositions, lectures, writings, and collaborations with choreographer Merce Cunningham and artists such as Robert Rauschenberg made him internationally famous, and led him to be one of the most influential music personalities of the last century. In celebration of the centennial of this truly remarkable icon of modern music, The Marta and Austin Weeks Music Library is pleased to present an dual physical/digital exhibit of scores, audio, video, and artwork by and about John Cage. This exhibit will be on display beginning September 2012.
